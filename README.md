#GCJ_Plugin
This plugin helps in doing some routine tasks in Google Code Jam just by right-clicking and selecting a option.
##This basically has two features :
  a) Create Folders : Creates folders for a typical Google Code Jam question, Small and Large each containing a copy of template.cpp.
  b) Execute : Complies and runs the A.cpp program on the input.txt file and produces output.txt file.
